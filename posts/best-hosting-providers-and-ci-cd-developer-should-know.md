As a web developer, we work on a lot of projects, and occasionally we want to share them with the rest of the world, which necessitates the use of hosting. So why should you pay when there are free choices available that provide CI/CD right out of the box.

I've tried a lot of hosting companies, and while they're all fine, I've chosen the best ones that are simple to set up and will have your website up and running as quickly as possible.

1 . Cloudflare Pages

![cloudflare Pages image ](https://res.cloudinary.com/amrohan/image/upload/v1641011690/Images/djuaz3odyjuesiugksvw.png)

Cloudflare's static site hosting is jam stack hosting, but it now has full stack support thanks to the inclusion of Cloudflare workers. Cloudflare has a reputation for being easier to use than any of the other cloud companies I mentioned.

Cloudflare Pages might also have the finest CDN of any of the providers on this list. That alone is reason enough to give them a shot.

On Free Plan :

- 1 build at a time
- 500 builds/ month
- Unlimited sites
- Unlimited requests
- Unlimited **bandwidth**
- Instant rollbacks to any version

Try : [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

2 . Vercel

![Vercel image ](https://res.cloudinary.com/amrohan/image/upload/v1641012339/Images/hfq12jjkx5tjkeiqnflq.png)

In every case, Vercel offers the quickest website build times. It also has Slack connectivity, which gives us a lot of insight into our development process.

If you're working on a website and want the quickest build time and instant preview in Slack, I'd recommend Vercel over another option.

On Free Plan :

- Bandwidth 100 GB/month
- Unlimited Sites
- Serverless Function Execution 100 GB-Hrs
- Edge Function Invocations (Beta) 3,000,000
- Build Execution 100 Hrs
- Instant rollbacks to any version

Try : [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

3 . Netlify

![Netlify Image ](http://res.cloudinary.com/amrohan/image/upload/v1641012809/Images/nnzbdplbjm9c1qvr22j0.png)

Netlify is similar to Vercel, but it has its own edge network, which drastically reduces the time it takes for your site to load.

It also comes with its own authentication, which you can easily integrate into your web app.

On Free Plan :

- Bandwidth 100 GB/month
- Build Time 300 min/month
- Unlimited Sites
- Concurrent builds 1
- Instant rollbacks to any version

Try : [Vercel](https://www.netlify.com/)

4 . Github Pages

![GitHub Pages ](http://res.cloudinary.com/amrohan/image/upload/v1641013509/Images/vf1dc7dswwei2z4wkjkh.png)

The granddaddy of static site hosting is GitHub Pages. And, come to think of it, it was the very first static site host I tested! I had no idea what was going on or what I was doing. I just went to GitHub Pages and launched the website.

I think GitHub Pages is a wonderful alternative for an open source project's "homepage." It's not something I'd use for anything else.

On Free Plan :

- Bandwidth limit of 100GB per/month
- GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds/hour

Try : [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

5 . Giltab Pages

![Gitlab Pages Image ](http://res.cloudinary.com/amrohan/image/upload/v1641013846/Images/ls8repmibjtccandbil9.jpg)

Gitlab Pages is similar to Gitgub, but it offers private repository hosting, which Github does not.

On Free Plan :

- Bandwidth **Unlimited**
- Build times 400 min/month

Try : [Gitlab Pages](https://gitlab.com/)

6 . Render

Render is a unified cloud where you can develop and host all of your apps and websites. It comes with free TLS certificates, a worldwide CDN, DDoS protection, private networks, and auto deploys from git.

On Free Plan:

- Unlimited Sites
- Bandwidth 100 gb/month
- Instant Rollbacks

Try : [Render](https://render.com/)

7 . Firebase

![Firebase image ](http://res.cloudinary.com/amrohan/image/upload/v1641016717/Images/zpm4pvl4aasu6tifiwxt.jpg)

Firebase is one of the quickest web hosting providers, and they use **fastly** as their CDN under the hood.
Firebase not only hosts websites, but also offers data storage, user authentication, Google analytics, and more.

Using GitHub Actions, you may use Firebase as a CI/CD system.

On Free Plan :

- Bandwidth 10 GB/month
- 1 GB of Storage
  > but it comes with twist it only gives **360 MB/Day**

Try : [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

8 . Surge

![surge website](http://res.cloudinary.com/amrohan/image/upload/v1641014468/Images/lhlmdjashdqu3mcpibfb.png)

Surge is a one-command web publishing system. Without leaving the command line, publish HTML, CSS, and JS for free.

Simply go to your static assets directory and run the command'surge', and your site will be automatically deployed to the internet. It's that simple, and they also have the fastest load time, similar to cloudflare pages.

**This one doesn't come with CI/CD right out of the box.**

On Free Plan:

- Unlimited Sites
- Bandwidth haven't mentioned on there site

Try : [Surge](https://surge.sh)

## What I would recommend

According to my personal experience, if you want the fastest CDN, a quick build time, and instant rollback, cloudflare pages are the way to go.

However, if your website is still in development and you want a quick build time as well as slack integration, I would recommend Vercel

Choose between Cloudflare, Vercel, or Netlify, all of which are excellent choices.
