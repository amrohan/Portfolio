# Link Tree Alternative

## What is linktree ?

Linktree works by creating a landing page on their site, which features multiple links to your site. You simply copy and paste your Linktree landing page URL into your Instagram bio to raise awareness of other parts of your site.

### Why should you make your own LinkTree, though?

- No watermark.
- Also why should you pay when you can make it by yourself.
- It's easy to make one.

### Make one like this ðŸ‘‡

Before we begin, you should be familiar with the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

### So question is how you do it?

- Simply use html and CSS to make things simple. Although it won't be as dynamic as the original linktree, you may make it so by using a framework like react or nextjs.
